# Finding-the-peak

Given a text file that contains list of distinct integers line by line such that the values f the integers increase up to some index p and then decreases for all indices beyond p through n-1, this program helps find the peak value and at which peak index p does it occur. This program uses the idea of Divide and Conquer to find the peak value efficiently.
